THIS PROJECT IS NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE

These Python files simulate a compliance chamber model. 
This is one of the most accessible models, as it does not require any extensive knowledge in biology or fluid mechanics.

For more details, read : Modeling and simulation in medecine and the life sciences, Frank C. Hoppensteadt & Charles S. Peskin
It contains a lot of things I used to write these programms.

Contents :
* 1_chamber_model.py : The simplest possible model, only contains the systemic arteries, with inward and outward flows.
* 2_chamber_model.py : Intermediate complexity. Contains the left ventricle and the systemic arteries, with associated flows and with valves represented by variables SMi & SAo
* Complete_model.py [DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY] : The complete model of the entire circulation.
* Blood_flow.png : Figure of the blood flow in the body.
* Blood_flow_IDs.png : The same figure, with numbers representing each chamber (useful to understand Complete_model.py)
